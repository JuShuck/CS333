JoinTest4 running.

   This test forks a child process and then waits on it twice.
   The first call to Sys_Join should return its error code; the
   second call to Sys_Join should return -1.

The PID of the child = 2
This should print first.
This should print second.
Okay (1).
Okay (2).
This should print first.
The PID of the child = 3
This should print second.
Okay (3).
Okay (4).

   In the next test, we create 2 children, and each creates 2 children,
   giving 7 processes in all.  Then each process attempts a Sys_Join on
   every process except its own children, to make sure the result is -1.
   Finally, each process with children waits on them.
