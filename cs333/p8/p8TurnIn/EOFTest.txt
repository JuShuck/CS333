==========  EOFTest  ==========

This test should be run in 'raw' mode.

This function tests the handling of control-D.  Control-D is the
enf-of-file character.  When typed, it should cause an immediate
return from the Read syscall.  If no other characters have been
typed first, then the count returned from Read will be zero, which
many programs will interpret as 'end-of-file'.

Please hit control-D next.  The ENTER key should not be necessary...
Okay.
Please type "abc" followed by control-D.  The ENTER key should not be necessary...
Okay.

==========  Test Complete  ==========
