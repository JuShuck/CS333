==========  EchoTest  ==========

This test reads characters from the terminal.  It echoes each character, as it is received.

  1. Start by typing "abc\n"
  2. See what happens with characters like cntl-H (Backspace), cntl-J (NL) and cntl-M (CR).
  3. See what happens when you hit keys labelled SPACE, ENTER/RETURN, TAB, DEL/BACKSPACE, and ESC.
  4. See what happens when you hit cntl-D (EOF).
  5. Try this test in cooked mode and in raw mode.
  6. While in raw mode, see what happens with sequences from page 342 in the textbook.
     For example, try typing these sequences:
         ESC  [  7  m
         ESC  [  5  A
         control-g
         up-arrow

This test will terminate when 'q' is typed.

(To change to cooked mode, type control-C, "cooked", and "g" to resume execution.
To change to raw mode, type control-C, ENTER, ENTER, "raw", and "g" to resume execution.)
