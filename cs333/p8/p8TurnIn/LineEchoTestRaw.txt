==========  LineEchoTest  ==========

This program reads an entire line of input (up to 30 characters) into a buffer.
After this program gets the entire line, it prints it.  Since this program
does not echo characters as typed, you will not see the characters until after
the entire line is completed by typing ENTER, when running the emulator in raw
mode.  In cooked mode, the host (Unix) will echo characters and then, after the
line is complete, this program will (re) print the line.

  1. Start by typing "abc\n"
  2. See what happens with characters like cntl-H (Backspace), cntl-J (NL) and cntl-M (CR).
  3. See what happens when you hit keys labelled SPACE, ENTER/RETURN, TAB, DEL/BACKSPACE, and ESC.
  4. See what happens when you hit cntl-D (EOF).
  5. See what happens when the size of the buffer is exceeded.
  6. In cooked mode, see how the host (Unix) processes editing keys, such as backspace.

This test will terminate when the first character entered is 'q'.

(To change to cooked mode, type control-C, "cooked", and "g" to resume execution.
To change to raw mode, type control-C, ENTER, ENTER, "raw", and "g" to resume execution.)


Number of characters entered = 6
abcde

Number of characters entered = 12
hello there

Number of characters entered = 2
q

==========  Test Complete  ==========
